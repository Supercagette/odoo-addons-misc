Add some feature for users who sale in street
=============================================

Features
--------
* Add a market place object;
    * a PoS has now an extra field 'market_place_id' that mentions where the
      sale has been done;
    * Possibility to select a Market place in Front Office or in Back Office;
* Add the possibility to change the date of a pos order, for users of a
  specific new group, because in some case, user will not have an odoo instance
  during the sale, and will tip the PoS orders a few hours later or a a few
  days later;
